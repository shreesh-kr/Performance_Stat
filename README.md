# PERFORMANCE STAT
This is a small app developed to track performance of the subject on various grounds.
These grounds are already mentioned, and the subject needs to check the task he/ she has performed for a period of 24 hours.
Every tick gives 1 point to the subject. The time period of this study is 100 days
and therefore can also be used to check the performance in the #100DAYCHALLENGE.


## USAGE
To use this app is simple.

The subject simply needs to tick the task he/ she has performed that day and leave the one's he/ she did not.
Once the subject has ticked all the task's performed, just hit the 'save' button and that's it.

To view the performance hit the 'View Stats' button and se the generated report on your performance.
The success of this app depends on the honesty of the subject- Tick what you have done, don't cheat.
